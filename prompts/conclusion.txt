- Ensure that your conclusion effectively wraps up the article and reinforces the central message or insights presented in the blog post.
- Do not repeat a simple summary of the main points of the article. Add a call to action if necessary or a question to engage the reader.

- The conclusion should be short, 1 small paragraph.
- Respect web writing standards:
1. Paragraphs should be short and informative.
